Gold! Its warm, glowing lustre appeals universally to humans across vast cultural and geographic boundaries. It has been used since times of old to adorn both people and their many creations, bringing elegance to all. Even now, gold retains its significance in our lives, as it continues to be an essential financial investment for many people.

Being such a highly desirable commodity, it’s no surprise that whenever a large amount of gold has popped up, it has been swiftly accompanied by an influx of people eager to be the first ones to find it and reap the immense profits. But to many, these ‘gold rushes’ only brought false hope. The culprit: iron pyrite, commonly known as fool’s gold. This two-faced mineral appeared as gold to the undiscerning eye, but that was all it had in common. Pyrite was brittle, unable to bend as flexibly as real gold, and when scraped, left a dark brown streak as opposed to its counterpart’s golden streak. That left pyrite as a relatively worthless mineral, a sad disappointment compared to the metal it was masquerading as. 

But let’s not be too hasty – the name ‘fool’s gold’ gives pyrite MUCH less credit than it is due. Iron pyrite, FeS2, has been ubiquitous throughout human history. Our ancestors would strike two pieces of it together to produce fire – small fragments would break off and react with the oxygen in the atmosphere, producing sparks. It has also directly contributed to the creation and success of the pharma, chemical and weapons industries. 

Since pyrite contains sulphur, it has remained an essential source of the non-metal to this day. It also gives us access to sulphuric acid, a massive milestone for the chemical industry: it unlocks the ability to produce fertilizers, pesticides, detergents, dyes, pigments and paints, paper, explosives, lubricants and batteries. On the pharmaceutical side, sulphur oxide gases obtained from burning pyrite were used to treat congestion and fumigation. Sulphurous acid could be used in creams to treat skin conditions like acne and eczema due to its antibacterial properties.  

But does fool’s gold still hold relevance in our world today? Oh, and how! Something we have known for quite some time is this: if we do happen to find fool’s gold, then the real deal may not be that far off. They tend to form in the same rock types under similar conditions. We regularly find traces of gold in pyrites in microscopic crystal defects or as nanoparticles and alloys. As such, we find pyrites with as much as 0.25% gold by weight. If we could extract most of this gold through leaching, the value of boring old pyrite would skyrocket. We just have to know where to look – in veins of minerals like calcite or quartz, pyrite undergoes oxidation to iron oxides or hydroxides, forming an oxidation “zone” that can be easily targeted. 

Another very promising avenue is pyrite’s use as a semiconductor. Silicon is the primary semiconductor with which solar panels are made nowadays, but pyrite blows it out of the water in every aspect. It absorbs 100 times as much light as silicon and costs 50 times less to extract. A layer of it 100 nanometres wide absorbs 90% of incident radiation, whereas its thicker silicon rivals absorb less than 20%. 

Pyrite has also been used in a landmark study that has managed to electrically transform a non-magnetic material into a ferromagnetic one for the first time ever. The pyrite was placed in contact with an ionic solution through a process called electrolyte gating, and a tiny voltage, only about 1 volt, was applied. The pyrite suddenly became magnetic but, like a switch, reverted to being diamagnetic as soon as the voltage was removed. 

Pyrite was once thought of as nothing more than an unfortunate find on the road to a real treasure but has since proven its worth to us time and time again. Whatever its future may be, it’s safe to say that even the wise must recognize the worth in fool’s gold.
