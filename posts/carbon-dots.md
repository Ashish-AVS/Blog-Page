# WHAT ARE CARBON DOTS?

So, starting with a basic introduction – Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as gifts in nanotechnology because of their magical properties and application. CDs have an average diameter of less than 10nm. These CDs are derived from organic compounds and are stable in an aqueous medium. A significant role is played by surface engineering for CDs in diversified applications like chemical sensing, food safety, bioimaging, drug delivery, etc. The chemical properties of CDs vary, tuning their shapes and sizes and the doping of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, Sulphur, and boron. Both natural and synthetic organic precursors can be used to synthesize CDs.

# WHAT LED TO ITS DISCOVERY?

CDs were discovered accidentally in 2004 while purification of single-wall carbon nanotubes by Xu et Au. Within a headwater soluble CDs passivated with poly – propionyl ethylene co-ethylenimine has been reported by sun et al. The as-prepared CDs showed two-photon induced luminescence spectra and were utilized to detect human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

# NOW WE COME TO THEIR ARCHITECTURE

These CDs are the youngest member of the family of the nanoworld. CDs are both sp2 and sp3 hybrid carbon networks. It can easily be combined with hydroxyl, carbonyl, amino, and other such groups over their surface, thereby offering an extra advantage for binding with both inorganic and organic moieties. These functional groups attached allow the surfaces of CDs to espouse them with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic character to provide thermodynamic stabilities in different solvents, especially in water. CDs do not exhibit any kind of photoluminescent activities. Surface modifications in CDs by diverse functional group, passivating agent and solvent, reflects smart variation in their properties.

# BUT HOW CAN WE SYNTHESIZE THEM? LET’S READ –

For making CDs with various photophysical properties and functionalities, several easy synthetic methodologies have been created. Synthetic pathways, are divided into two – bottom-up and top-down

# Bottom-up Approach

CDs are synthesized by microwave irradiation, hydrothermal, and pyrolysis methods from small molecules in the “bottom-up” technique.

## 1.Microwave irradiation method-

Thanks to their time-saving, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly nature, microwave (Mw) methodologies have gained considerable attention in the scientific community. In this process, the carbonization of the small organic molecule occurs within a short time by microwave heating.

##  2.Hydrothermal method

Because of their non-toxic, environmentally safe, low cost, and simple operational technique, the hydrothermal methodology may be the most promising technique for the synthesis of CDs in recent years. In this technique, in a synthetic hydrothermal reactor, a solution of organic precursors is sealed where the reaction occurs at high temperature and pressure.

## 3.Pyrolysis method

Pyrolysis is an easy process for synthesizing CDs from organic compounds through simple chemical reactions carried out in the presence of strong acid or alkali at a very high temperature. Martindale et al. synthesized CDs with a mean diameter of ~6 nm by citric acid pyrolysis at 180 °C for the production of solar energy using hydrogen fuel.

# b) Top-down approach

In the “top-down” methodology, laser ablation, electrochemical oxidation, and arc discharge method are used to synthesize CDs.

## 1.Electrochemical method

The electrochemical approach synthesizes ultrapure CDs via an electrolytic process from larger molecular matter such as carbon nanotube, graphite, and carbon fiber. Larger organic molecules are used as an electrode in the presence of proper electrolytes.

## 2.Laser Ablation Method

For producing CDs of different sizes, the laser ablation process has been commonly used. Complex organic macromolecules are exposed in the laser ablation pathway under laser radiation performed in CW or pulsed mode, and nanosized carbon particles are isolated from the larger molecular structures.

## 3.Arc Discharge Method

An accidental incident was CDs using an arc discharge process. Xu et al. first mentioned this method during the synthesis of SWCNTs[8]. The production of tiny carbon fragments or CDs results in electrical discharge between two graphite electrodes. 

# SO WHAT ABOUT ITS APPLICATIONS ?

## 1.Detection of toxic chemical in food

Owing to the presence of hazardous materials such as heavy metal ions, pesticides, antibiotics, preservatives, and nonbiodegradable chemicals, more than a certain amount of allowable limit in foodstuffs, severe health problems can be induced. For ultrasensitive detection of heavy and highly poisonous metal iodines, CD-based PL quenching sensors are used.

## 2.Detection of Explosives

The global focus has been drawn to the identification and tracking of explosives concerning national and international security. Picric acid, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and dinitrotoluene (DNT) are very widely known explosives that are life-threatening to humankind, even at trace concentrations.

## 3.Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)

SERS was developed as an elegant analytical technique to detect molecules down to a single molecule detection limit at ultrasensitive concentrations. However, because of the lack of proper interaction of organic molecules with metal or metal complexes, SERS spectra obtained from dielectric molecular assays and surface plasmon materials are not successful.

## 4.Drug Delivery, Bioimaging, and Biosensing

Due to their outstanding biocompatibility, water-solubility, non-toxic, photoluminescent, and high photostability, CDs are used in health and medicinal chemistry for drug delivery, bioimaging, and also in the development of successful biosensors.

CQDs’ explored properties and their regulations are fascinating for extensive scientific applications, which have been demonstrated. New properties and subtly tuning these properties, such as fresh phosphorescence and debatable UCPL, are also challengeable for its nubilous luminescent mechanism. The amorphous to the nearly crystalline internal structure, nonquantitative surface structure, and virtual size polydisperse may block the clarification of the luminescence mechanism. This problem will be solved through accurate synthesis, careful analysis, and intelligent consideration.

This how we can introduce the amazingly magical Carbon dots. We sum up here itself. But you can continue to read about this extraordinary yet important discovery.
