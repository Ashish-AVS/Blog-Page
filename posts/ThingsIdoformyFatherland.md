Have you ever heard of Fritz Haber? The German scientist once popularly said, “In peace, a scientist belongs to the world; during war, he belongs to his Fatherland.“

Every invention and discovery we make can be used for noble or evil. Dr. Fritz Haber is recognized as the person who saved millions of lives by inventing the Bosch-Haber process to extract nitrogen from thin air and prepare fertilizers on a larger scale. Still, during World War 1, Dr. Haber used this technology to develop a poison gas used in chemical warfare, which killed thousands of soldiers and dishonored every war ethic.

Haber invented this unique process to save Europe from starvation; it is a sequence of processes leading to the formation of ammonia. It directly combines nitrogen from the air with hydrogen under extremely high pressure and moderately high temperature. Iron is used as a catalyst and molybdenum as a moderator. The immediate removal of formed ammonia increases its yield by Le-Chatelier’s Principle of Equilibrium.

The Haber-Bosch process is the most economical for nitrogen fixation. This process is still used in chemical industries to make fertilizers and indirectly helps to feed 70% of the world’s population. For his invention, Dr. Haber was awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1918 but was condemned later on for using the same invention during the World War, which is directly responsible for the death of thousands.
Albert Einstein, a close associate to Dr. Haber, was once quoted saying to him, “Life cannot be balanced like an equation. Good deeds do not erase the evil ones.“

With the help of Wilhelm Ostwald, Haber’s process was used to make explosives and irritants essential for modern warfare like tear gas and chlorine. The gas that Dr. Haber made was disposed of using a system of pipelines. The wind carried the cloud of chlorine gas into the French trenches and unable to escape, the soldiers suffocated to death. It was equivalent to death by drowning but on dry land.

Once inhaled, the chlorine gas diffuses into the epithelial lining fluid of the respiratory epithelium and may directly interact with small molecules, proteins and lipids and damage them, or may hydrolyze to form hypochlorous and hydrochloric acid. This, in turn, generates chloride ions and reactive oxygen species. The dominant theory is that acids do the most damage.

The soldiers who inhaled the gas were observed to have a splitting headache, knife-edge pain in the lungs, coughing greenish froth off the stomach and lungs, and an unbearable thirst which was the worst part (as drinking water in that situation would mean instant death). It would have burned the person from inside. It was indeed a brutal death that came upon the French soldiers. With the death of over 10,000 French soldiers on the first trial, Dr. Haber was promoted to the rank of captain and given the nickname “Dr. Poison.”

Despite being a devout patriot and devoting his life to his country, Dr. Haber was sacked from employment due to his Jewish origin. He was dishonorably dismissed from his work despite devising trials to recover gold from seawater to help the German economy. Even after all his accomplishments as a scientist, Dr. Haber lost his wife and prestige due to his acts for his Fatherland. He is the perfect personification of the debate over science’s capacity for good and evil.
