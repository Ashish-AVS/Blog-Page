What exactly made “Requiem for a Dream” such a hit movie? Well, obviously apart from the brilliant storyline and breathtaking performances by the likes of Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto among others, the fact that it deals with one of the most significant problems that has affected the human kind since forever, i.e.”Drug Addiction”.

# WHAT IS DRUG ADDICTION?

Addiction is a disease that affects your brain and behaviour. When you’re addicted to drugs, you can’t resist the urge to use them even when you’re aware of the harm it does to your body.

Drug addiction isn’t about just heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can get addicted to alcohol, nicotine, opioid painkillers, sleep and anti-anxiety medications, and other legal substances.

At first, you may choose to take a drug because you like the way it makes you feel. You may think you can control how much and how often you use it. But over time, drugs change how your brain works. These physical changes can last a long time. They make you lose self-control and can lead you to damaging behavior.

# CHEMISTRY BEHIND DRUG ADDICTION

Despite the importance of numerous psychosocial factors, at its core, drug addiction involves a biological process: the ability of repeated exposure to a drug of abuse to induce changes in a vulnerable brain that drive the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs, and loss of control over drug use, that define a state of addiction.

Neuronal synaptic transmission involves:

Neurotransmitter presynaptic release 
Receptor binding, binding site release and 
Neurotransmitter degradation/reuptake Drug molecules “look like” natural substrates bind to receptor, transporter, or enzyme active sites 
Impact of a drug depends upon the strength of binding, which depends upon:

  * Shape & positioning of functional groups 
  * Hydrogen bonding 
  * Salt bridges 
  * π-stacking 
  * π-cation interactions 
  * Hydrophobic contacts 
  * Conformational rigidity 
Ability to pass through hydrophobic blood-brain barrier
What makes for the difference between someone who can drink or dabble in illicit drugs without developing dependence (or many negative consequences) versus someone who becomes an addict?

Stress level 
Genetic background 
Other biological factors 
Environment 
Social context in which drug use is occurring
EFFECTS OF DRUG ADDICTION ON YOUR BRAIN

Your brain is wired to make you want to repeat experiences that make you feel good. So you’re motivated to do them again and again.

The drugs that may be addictive target your brain’s reward system. They flood your brain with a chemical called dopamine. This triggers a feeling of intense pleasure. So you keep taking the drug to chase that high.

Over time, your brain gets used to the extra dopamine. So you might need to take more of the drug to get the same good feeling. And other things you enjoyed, like food and hanging out with family, may give you less pleasure.

When you use drugs for a long time, it can cause changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well. They can hurt your:

  * Judgment
  * Decision making
  * Memory
  * Ability to learn
Together, these brain changes can drive you to seek out and take drugs in ways that are beyond your control.

# WHEN TO GET HELP

If you feel that at any point, your drug use is out of control or causing harmful effects, consider getting in touch with and talking to a doctor immediately.

Getting better from drug addiction can take time, it’s definitely not an overnight process. There’s no one stop shop solution, but the right treatment can help you stop using drugs and even stay drug-free. This may include counselling, medicine, or both.
