“Alexa, deliver my package to the address: House No. 09, Street X, Area Y on Mars.” I hope you can fathom this happening because I totally can. With the successful landing of Perseverance, humanity is taking giant leaps (literally) towards unlocking the key to one of the biggest enigmas – “Is life possible on Mars?” Soon dreams may shift from going on a world tour to a trip to Mars. Elon Musk’s statement of humans becoming interplanetary beings is not sounding as absurd right now as before! With findings suggesting previous life presence on Mars and technology advancing at the speed of light, we may soon start to pack our bags, put on the specialized suits and take off to Mars.

The reports from Curiosity paved the path for scientists to question the unthinkable. The samples, pictures and results from the rover pushed us in the right direction, confirming the theories on paper to be accurate. However, the technology of 2020 far exceeds that of 2011. NASA has sent the rover Perseverance with top-notch technology to unravel mysteries and answer the question, “Can green be brought to planet red?”

Perseverance was designed keeping Curiosity’s shortcomings in mind. It was redesigned to be more durable, efficient with the latest technology and materials. This 1,025 kg rover had advanced science instruments like Mastcam-Z, MEDA, MOXIE, PIXL, RIMFAX, SHERLOC and SuperCam, utilizing science to its absolute glory to acquire information about Martian geology, atmosphere and possible biosignatures.

SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organic and Chemicals) is an instrument that uses Raman spectroscopy to determine a sample’s key aspects and to identify whether it contains carbonaceous matter, the deciding factor of the presence of life. The Raman spectrum represents the vibration of an atom in response to laser light. Most importantly, it helps scientists determine the hydrogen to carbon ratio, which will help determine how much alteration the sample has undergone—this aids in understanding the earliest forms of life and, thus, evolution.

SuperCam is another instrument to identify the soil and rocks’ chemical compositions using cameras, lasers, and spectrometers. It’s an improvisation on the ChemCam of Curiosity. It can analyze the samples of soil and take color pictures instead of black and white. It can see up to a great distance which the rover cannot reach. Its components (Raman spectroscope, TRF and VISIR spectroscope) use advanced technology like LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) to obtain the spectra in the visible and IR regions to determine the sample composition and to clear the dust for clear pictures.

MOXIE (Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment) will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere’s carbon dioxide using solid oxide electrolysis. This will help to effectively create technology to provide an oxidizer for Mars Ascent Vehicle in a human-machine. MEDA (Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer) will help study dust and its impact on weather and measure the air temperature, radiation, relative humidity and pressure. This will help us know whether the martian atmosphere is suitable for us humans.

Yes, we have been making significant advancements. Still, it will be decades later that we can think of establishing on Mars. While the findings indicate Mars to be the next best option for us, the atmosphere there does not contain sufficient oxygen while being too cold. However, it’s not futile to dream about having a future on Mars: living in an egg-shaped heated pod, wearing specialized suits and having those odd food concentrates surrounded by dust and reddish hues!
