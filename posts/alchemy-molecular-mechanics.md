‘A great machine isn’t about huge things, it is about small things making a huge difference.’ While it may seem small, the ripple effects are extraordinary. Machines are everywhere – from the most complex computers to the simplest pencil, anything which makes our work easy is a machine. The human body is one of the most complex machines. It is composed of millions of machines constantly working, tirelessly, to make our body function properly. 

A molecular machine is an assembly of a distinct number of molecular components designed to perform machine-like movements as a result of an appropriate stimulus. Every machine has a basic working structure: Input – Process – Output. Molecular machines use the energy currency of the body, ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), and are about 1000 times smaller than common molecules.

In 1930, the study took a giant leap when Dr. Jean Pierre Sauvage introduced template synthesis as a straightforward route to catenanes. Catenanes are interlocked molecules composed of two macrocycles. In short, these are two ring-shaped molecules linked into small chains. Rotaxanes, on the other hand, are interlocked molecules composed of a macrocycle with an axle molecule threaded through it, kept in place by bulky end groups. This discovery invigorated the field of topological chemistry and opened the gateway to an entirely new field of molecular machinery.

The study took another leap when Sir James Fraser Stoddart discovered an alternative template-based method to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, in which interactions between electron-rich and electron-poor aromatic entities were used. With further study, these resulting structures developed into molecular shuttles. Through collaboration with Dr. Sauvage, they demonstrated reversible catenane shapeshifting. 

For any machine to be functional and useful to us, it should be programmable, easy to control, and perform the operations we intend it to perform. In 1999, Dr. Bernard L. Feringa demonstrated a controlled unidirectional rotation, a movement typically seen in a motor. He used overcrowded alkenes and asymmetries in the molecules to obtain a unidirectional rotation by light irradiation and thermal relaxation. He and his team developed a motor that consists of a molecular rotor that spins in just one direction when powered by heat and light.

This motor was called (3R, 3’R)-(P, P)-trans 1,’1,2,’2,3,’3,4,’4,-octahydro-3,’3-dimethyl-4,’4-biphenanthryanlidene. Pretty cool, isn’t it?

These isomerisable unsaturated bonds have been the most important part of the development of molecular machines. They have incorporated the mechanical bond and unidirectional rotation into a functional molecular machine and constitute the foundation of the entire study. This technology can later be used to develop nanotechnology, which in turn can enhance medical aid. For example, suppose nerve damage is found. In that case, these molecular machines can be stimulated to operate on it and repair the nerve damage with higher precision, to repair torn muscles, to treat genetic disorders. Further, they can be useful in computers, smart materials and energy storing devices. First, chemists came up with a molecular switch, which can be a base for more complex machinery. At present, chemists have developed molecular stir bars, molecular ratchets, molecular elevators, molecular muscles, and molecular cars.

In the year 2016, Dr. Sauvage, Sir Stoddart and Dr. Bernard were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their design and synthesis of molecular machines, which in the future has a wide range of applications. It’s just a matter of time before we can utilize this technology to its full potential!
