“You take the drink first, then the drink takes the drink, and then the drink takes you,” says the adage. This simple yet powerful line from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel “The Great Gatsby” got me thinking about the never-ending epidemic of alcohol abuse that has plagued humanity since the dawn of time.

We all know the key causes of alcoholism: social pressure, a stressful atmosphere, a family background, and so on. However, have you ever thought about the chemistry of alcoholism and how to cope with it? Keep reading to find out!

## What is alcoholism?

Alcoholism, also known as alcohol addiction, is a chronic, progressive, and potentially fatal disease that causes psychological or physical dependency or addiction. Alcohol’s morbidity and mortality extend to those who misuse it; in addition to declining personal wellbeing, it has been linked to an increased risk of injuries, as well as higher rates of crime and violence.

## Chemistry behind it –

Individual drinking habits are usually influenced by positive and/or negative feedback mechanisms.

The rewarding and desirable effects of alcohol are largely determined by dopamine and serotonin levels in the body, so the positive reinforcing effects of alcohol are described at the neurotransmitter stage.

Negative reinforcement, or the relief of negative or psychological states by alcohol, causes an increase in corticotropin-releasing factor recruitment and a decrease in GABA transmission (it is primarily linked to blocking certain brain signals in the nervous system and producing a calming effect).

Long-term alcohol exposure induces adaptive changes in the aforementioned neurotransmitters, to the point that the individual is unable to work normally without it. Although abruptly stopping (alcohol withdrawal) may trigger nervous system hyperactivity and dysfunction, resulting in anxiety, exhaustion, insomnia, and, in extreme cases, seizures, hallucinations, and even heart failure.

## Alcohol de-addiction –

Treating alcohol addiction can prove to be complex and challenging, while there are various factors involved in it, none of those will work if the person in concern doesn’t want a sober life.

There are various treatment options for alcoholism such as:

Rehab: One of the most common treatments, wherein the person might go for an inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program.
Support groups: Individuals with common backgrounds and interests form groups to provide emotional and moral support. When making the transition to sobriety, it is recommended to get involved with at least one such organization, regardless of the form of support system.
Pharmacological treatment: Only three drugs have been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food & Drug Administration) for use in alcohol de-addiction:

                            I. Acamprosate

                            II. Naltrexone
                            
                            III.Disulfiram

1.  Acamprosate: It works by antagonizing the activities of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal process. Acamprosate can minimize or avoid alcohol withdrawal-related neurotoxicity by lowering excessive NMDA activity, which occurs at the onset of alcohol withdrawal.

2.  Naltrexone: Alcohol allows the body to release endorphins, which allow dopamine to be released and reward receptors to be activated, reducing the pleasurable effects of drinking. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that effectively blocks the effects of endorphins and opioids.

3.  Disulfiram: Disulfiram prevents the body from eliminating acetaldehyde, a chemical generated when ethanol is broken down. Many hangover symptoms are caused by acetaldehyde, which is produced when alcohol is consumed.

Apart from the first three, Europe has approved treatment with the fourth form, Nalmefene, though its efficacy is still debatable, according to a meta-analysis.

Despite the fact that most of these drugs have been around for decades, only a small number of people have benefited from them. As Gerard Schmidt, an addiction counselor and president of the Association for Addiction Professionals, puts it, “Medications are just the beginning of how you make the psychological change that needs to occur.”
